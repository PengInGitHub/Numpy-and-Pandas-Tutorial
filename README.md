Six Important things you should know about Numpy and Pandas</br>
The data manipulation capabilities of pandas are built on top of the numpy library. In a way, numpy is a dependency of the pandas library.</br>
Pandas is best at handling tabular data sets comprising different variable types (integer, float, double, etc.). In addition, the pandas library can also be used to perform even the most naive of tasks such as loading data or doing feature engineering on time series data.</br>
